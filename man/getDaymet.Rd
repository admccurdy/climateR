\arguments{
\item{AOI}{an sf point or polygon to extract data for}

\item{varname}{variable name to extract (e.g. tmin)}

\item{startDate}{a start date given as "YYYY-MM-DD" to extract data for}

\item{endDate}{an end date given as "YYYY-MM-DD" to extract data for}

\item{verbose}{Should messages be emited?}

\item{dryrun}{Return summary of data prior to retrieving it}
}
\value{
if AOI is polygon a list of SpatRasters, if AOI is a point then a data.frame of modeled records.

\description{
This dataset provides Daymet Version 4 model output data as gridded estimates of daily weather parameters for North America.
Daymet output variables include the following parameters: minimum temperature, maximum temperature, precipitation, shortwave radiation,
vapor pressure, snow water equivalent, and day length. The dataset covers the period from January 1, 1980 to December 31 of the most recent full calendar year. Each subsequent year is processed individually at the close of a calendar year after
allowing adequate time for input weather station data to be of archive quality.  Daymet variables are continuous surfaces provided as individual files, by year, at a 1-km x 1-km spatial resolution and a daily temporal resolution. Data are in a Lambert Conformal
Conic projection for North America and are in a netCDF file format compliant with Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata conventions.
