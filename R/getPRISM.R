#' @title Get PRISM Climate Data for an Area of Interest
#' @description The Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) group gathers climate observations
#' from a wide range of monitoring networks, applies sophisticated quality control measures, and develops spatial climate datasets to reveal
#' short- and long-term climate patterns. The resulting datasets incorporate a variety of modeling techniques and are available at multiple spatial/temporal
#' resolutions, covering the period from 1895 to the present reflects observed patterns of daily near-surface meteorology and simulated changes in GCMs experiments.
#' @param AOI a spatial polygon object (sf or sp)
#' @param param a meterological parameter (see `param_meta$prism`)
#' @param startDate a start date given as "YYYY-MM-DD"
#' @param endDate an end date given as "YYYY-MM-DD"
#' @author Mike Johnson
#' @return if AOI is an areal extent a list of rasterStacks, if AOI is a point then a data.frame of modeled records.
