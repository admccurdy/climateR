#' @title Get EDDI Climate Data for an Area of Interest
#' @description The EDDI (Evaporative Demand Drought Index) is an experimental drought monitoring and early warning guidance tool. 
#' It examines how anomalous the atmospheric evaporative demand (E0; also known as "the thirst of the atmosphere") is for a given location 
#' across a time period of interest. EDDI is multi-scalar, meaning that this time  period â€”can vary to capture drying dynamics 
#' that themselves operate at different timescales. The EDDI for a given date is the aggregated values for a time period before hand. 
#' The time period is given in either a number of months or number of weeks. For example, a timestep of 3 and a timescale of weeks requests 
#' the EDDI values for the 3 weeks prior to the requested date.
#' @param AOI a spatial polygon object (sf or sp)
#' @param startDate a start date given as "YYYY-MM-DD"
#' @param endDate   an end date given as "YYYY-MM-DD"
#' @param timestep  The number of time steps (numeric). Must be between 1-12.
#' @param timescale Can be 'week' or 'month'
#' @return if AOI is an areal extent a list of rasterStacks, if AOI is a point then a data.frame of modeled records.
